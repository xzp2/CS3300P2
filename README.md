Introduction
----------------
For our final project, we wanted to analyze the number of Bigfoot sightings across the US and compare them to various state statistics to see if there was a correlation between those statistics and the number of sightings. We conducted a survey to see what variables people thought might affect sightings (i.e. population or lack thereof, forest cover, drug and alcohol usage, etc).
